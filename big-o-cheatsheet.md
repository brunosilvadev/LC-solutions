# Big O notes
O(1) Constant - No loops
O(n) Linear - for, while loops
O(n^2) Quadratic - every element in collection needs to be compared to every element

*Iterating through half a collection is still O(n)
*Two separete collections: O(a + b)

# Things that cost resources in a function
Math operations
Comparisons
Loops
Function calls

# Rules
1: Always worst case scenario
2: Remove constants
3: Different inputs should have different variables O(a + b)
4: Drop non-dominant terms (keep only the most expensive term)
